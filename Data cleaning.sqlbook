#### Addressing duplicate data
-- SQLBook: Code
SELECT * , ROW_NUMBER() over(PARTITION BY company, industry, total_laid_off,`date`) as row_num from layoffs;
SELECT * from (SELECT * , ROW_NUMBER() over(PARTITION BY company, industry, total_laid_off,`date`) as row_num from layoffs) as subquery where row_num>1;

DELETE FROM layoffs where company in 
(SELECT company from (SELECT company, ROW_NUMBER() over(PARTITION BY company, industry, total_laid_off,date) as row_num from layoffs) as subquery where row_num>1);

#### Column correction
-- SQLBook: Code
SELECT DISTINCT company FROM layoffs;
update layoffs
SET company = TRIM(company)
-- SQLBook: Code
SELECT DISTINCT country FROM layoffs;
UPDATE layoffs 
SET country = "United States"
where country LIKE "United States%";

#### Handling industries not represented in the data
-- SQLBook: Code
SELECT DISTINCT industry from layoffs;

SELECT * FROM layoffs where industry = "" or industry IS NULL;
-- it's existed in other rows

select l1.company,l1.industry,l2.industry from layoffs as l1 JOIN layoffs l2 ON
l1.company =l2.company 
where l1.industry = "" and l1.industry !=l2.industry;

UPDATE layoffs as l1 JOIN layoffs l2 ON l1.company =l2.company 
set l1.industry = l2.industry 
where l1.industry = "" and l1.industry !=l2.industry;

#### Dealing with date and time column
-- SQLBook: Code
SELECT date from layoffs;
UPDATE layoffs 
set `date` = STR_TO_DATE(`date`,'%m/%d/%Y')

ALTER Table layoffs
MODIFY COLUMN date DATE;

#### Addressing th null values
-- SQLBook: Code
SELECT *
FROM layoffs
WHERE total_laid_off IS NULL;

SELECT *
FROM layoffs
WHERE total_laid_off IS NULL
AND percentage_laid_off IS NULL;

DELETE from layoffs
where total_laid_off is NULL and percentage_laid_off is NULL;

#### Changing some columns data type
-- SQLBook: Code
ALTER TABLE layoffs
MODIFY percentage_laid_off FLOAT;
